Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

There are some cool projects I did in the past years that until recently were rotting in the basement of my private github repository. I decided to dust them off and release them to the public with a hope that you will find them as entertaining as I did. I plan to update stuff here every 2-3 weeks, as time allows. The changes on the GitHub may be more often.

For starters I decided to publish a "recompiler" - a crazy project that is able to convert a Xbox360 executable to run on 64-bit Windows. It's in a totally hobby state so no real games or apps can be run as of yet, but still I find it worth publishing.

In case of any questions feel free to drop me an email, my contact details are in the footer of the page.

Cheers,
Dex

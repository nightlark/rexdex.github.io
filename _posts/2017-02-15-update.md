I've updated the recompiler project a little bit. 

I decided to go toward a tracing compiler model with JIT compilation. Also, I plan to add support for more than one platform, this time it will be good old DOS. Up till now everything was kind of hardcoded for the Xbox360 but I think it's better to open up to more posibilities in the long run. The project was also moved to a new repository on GitHub.

A great help for anybody doing anything with Intel assembly is their free encoder/decoder library:
[IntelÂ® X86 Encoder Decoder Software Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/xed-x86-encoder-decoder-software-library)

It literally saves a month or more that would have to be spent otherwise + is much more tested :)

Cheers,
Dex
